However, in reality, choices may be modulated by recommendation systems which are typically trained to promote popular items and to reinforce users' historical behavior. As a result, the utility and user experience of content consumption can be affected implicitly and undesirably. To study this problem, we conducted a 2x2 randomized controlled field experiment (105 urban college students) to compare the effects of intention informed recommendations with classical intention agnostic systems. The study was conducted in the context of spoken word web content (podcasts) which is often consumed through subscription sites or apps. We modified a commercial podcast app to include (1) a recommender that takes into account users' stated intentions at onboarding, and (2) a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender during daily use. Our study suggests that: (1) intention-aware recommendations can significantly raise users' interactions (subscriptions and listening) with channels and episodes related to intended topics by over 24%, even if such a recommender is only used during onboarding, and (2) the CF-based recommender doubles users' explorations on episodes from not-subscribed channels and improves satisfaction for users onboarded with the intention-aware recommender.

Through extensive experiments on a large-scale podcast dataset (88,728 episodes from 18,433 channels), we show that (1) ALPR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art features developed for music and speech in predicting the seriousness and energy of podcasts, and (2) incorporating ALPR significantly improves the performance of topic-based podcast-popularity prediction.

As a result, the widely used Average-Over-All (AOA) evaluator is biased toward accurately recommending trendy items. In this paper, we (a) investigate evaluation bias of AOA and (b) develop an unbiased and practical offline evaluator for implicit MNAR datasets using the Inverse-Propensity-Scoring (IPS) technique.

Understanding how users interact with voice-based recommendations has the potential to inform better design of vocal recommenders. However, existing knowledge about user behavior is mostly for visual interfaces, such as the web, and is not directly transferable to voice interfaces, which rely on user listening and do not support skimming and browsing. To fill in the gap, we conducted a controlled study to compare user interactions with recommendations delivered visually to those with recommendations delivered vocally. Through an online A/B testing with 100 participants, we found that when recommendations are vocally conveyed, users consume more slowly, explore less, and choose fewer long-tail items. The study also reveals the correlation between user choices and exploration via voice interfaces.

However, with increasing data privacy concerns and personal data protection regulation, service providers such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook are enabling their users to revisit, erase, and rectify their historical profiles. Future recommendation systems need to be robust to such profile modifications and user-controlled data filtering. In this paper, we explore how recommendation performance may be affected by time-sensitive user data filtering, that is, users choosing to share only recent N days of data. Using the MovieLens dataset as a testbed, we evaluated three widely used collaborative filtering algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that filtering out historical user data does not significantly affect the overall recommendation performance, but its impact on individual users may vary. These findings challenge the common belief that more data is essential to better performance, and suggest a potential win--win solution for services and end users.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring Recommendations Under User-Controlled Data Filtering","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536710400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536710400,"objectID":"2afc3660a028daf2042a8d755dad799e","permalink":"https://ylongqi.com/talk/strata18/","publishdate":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/strata18/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Harnessing and Customizing State-of-the-art Recommendation Solutions with OpenRec","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Longqi Yang","Chen Fang","Hailin Jin","Matthew D.

Our model is able to attend to the most discriminative actions and sessions to make more accurate and directly interpretable predictions while requiring 50x less training data than the state-of-the-art sequential learning approach. We evaluate our model with two large scale datasets collected from 68K Photoshop users: a digital design skill dataset where the user skill is determined by the quality of the end products; and a software skill dataset where users self-disclose their software usage skill levels. The empirical results demonstrate our model's superior performance compared to existing user representation learning techniques that leverage action frequencies and sequential patterns. In addition, we qualitatively illustrate the model's significant interpretative power.

In this work, we propose OpenRec, an open and modular Python framework that supports extensible and adaptable research in recommender systems.

With the proliferation of image-centric social platforms, such as Pinterest, visual contents have become one of the most informative data streams for understanding user preferences. Traditional approaches usually treat visual content analysis as a general classification problem where one or more labels are assigned to each image. Although such an approach simplifies the process of image analysis, it misses the rich context and visual cues that play an important role in people's perception of images. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of learning a user's latent visual preferences directly from image contents. We propose a distance metric learning method based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to directly extract similarity information from visual contents and use the derived distance metric to mine individual users' fine-grained visual preferences. Through our preliminary experiments using data from 5,790 Pinterest users, we show that even for the images within the same category, each user possesses distinct and individually-identifiable visual preferences that are consistent over their lifetime.

A concern arises that the sensory information collected by the providers, although coarse-grained, can be subject to analysis that reveals private information about the users of the building. Oftentimes, multiple services are provided by the same company, in which case the potential for leakage of private information increases. Our research seeks to investigate the extent to which easily available sensory information may be used by external service providers to make occupancy-related inferences. Particularly, we focus on inferences from two different sources: motion sensors, which are installed and monitored by security companies, and smart electric meters, which are deployed by electric companies for billing and demand-response management. We explore the motion sensor scenario in a three-person single-family home and the electric meter scenario in a twelve-person university lab. Our exploration with various inference methods shows that sensory information available to service providers can enable them to make undesired occupancy related inferences, such as levels of occupancy or even the identities of current occupants, significantly better than naive prediction strategies that do not make use of sensor information.","tags":null,"title":"Inferring Occupancy from Opportunistically Available Sensor Data","type":"publication"}]
